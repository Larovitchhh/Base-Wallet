The Base Wallet is a non-custodial, self-custodial crypto wallet that allows users to store, manage, and interact with digital assets on the Base network, an Ethereum L2 blockchain built on the OP Stack in collaboration with Optimism. It is part of the Base App, which Coinbase rebranded in July 2025 to combine wallet functionalities with social networking, trading, and instant USDC payments. The wallet supports a wide range of assets, including Base ETH, tokens like USDT and USDC, NFTs, and dApps, making it a comprehensive tool for navigating the onchain economy.

Unlike custodial wallets, the Base Wallet gives users full control over their private keys, ensuring enhanced security and ownership of their assets. It is available as a mobile app for iOS and Android, as well as a browser extension, providing flexibility for users to manage their crypto on the go or from their desktop.
