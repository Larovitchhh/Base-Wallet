Creating and configuring a Base Wallet is simple and can be done in a few steps using the Base App or other EVM-compatible wallets like MetaMask. Here’s a quick guide to setting up the Base Wallet using the Base App:

Download the Base App  Visit the iOS App Store, Google Play Store, or Coinbase’s official website to download the Base App for mobile or the browser extension.

Create a New Wallet  Open the app and select “Create New Wallet.”  
Generate and securely store your 12-word recovery phrase (seed phrase). This phrase is critical for recovering your wallet, so write it down and store it offline in a safe place.  
Set a secure PIN for quick access to the wallet.

Connect to the Base Network  The Base App natively supports the Base network, so no manual configuration is needed. If using MetaMask or another EVM-compatible wallet, manually add the Base mainnet by entering the network details (available on Base’s official website or ChainList).

Fund Your Wallet  Navigate to the “Receive” page to find your Base wallet address.  
Purchase Base ETH or other tokens using a credit card via the app’s OTC service or bridge assets from Ethereum L1 or other chains using protocols like Bitget Swap.

Start Exploring  Once funded, you can send, receive, swap tokens, interact with dApps, or engage in social features like posting and earning rewards.
